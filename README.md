# Gerard's Web Dev Portfolio

This is a Next.js application showcasing some of my web development projects, alongside links to access resources such as my resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn, as well as a means to directly e-mail me.

This is currently deployed on https://gerardsanjuan.dev via SquareSpace.

If you wish to run this locally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
